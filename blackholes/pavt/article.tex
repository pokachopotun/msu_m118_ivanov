\begin{abstract}
In this paper we consider the task of finding so called Blackhole pattern in directed unweighed graphs.
Firstly, we analyse already existing algorithms and approaches. Secondly, we describe how structure of a graph
affects their efficiency. Then we introduce our approach to graph preprocessing. Finally, we describe topological sort based heuristic
and provide results of experimental comparison between our approach and previously developed algorithm.
