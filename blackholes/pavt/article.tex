\begin{abstract}
In this paper we consider the task of finding so called Blackhole pattern in directed unweighed graphs.
Firstly, we analyse already existing algorithms and approaches. Secondly, we describe how structure of a graph
affects their efficiency. Then we introduce our approach to graph preprocessing. Finally, we describe topological sort based heuristic
and provide results of experimental comparison between our approach and previously developed algorithm.

\section{Algorithm Design}
We propose to look at the blackhole search problem from the following: it would be divided into two independent tasks. 
The first one is graph preprocessing. Here we aim to simplify graph structure as far as it is possible with respect to a restricted time span. 
Decreased graph scale would definitely speed up the the calculation, as it can fall into a brute-force search in most cases.
The second is the blackhole search itself. This step is done after preprocessing and the goal here is to find as many blackholes as possible in a restricted time.

\subsection{Graph Preprocessing}
\FIXME{не забыть описать в KnownIssues}

\FIXME{не забыть вставить ссылки SmallWorld \cite{watts1999networks}}

As it was described in the Known Issues section, large SCCs waste lots of computational time without adding any new blackholes. 
For certain graph types (RMAT, SmallWorld) it can be crucial, because one SCC can contain up to 100\% of all graph's nodes. 
In such a case, it would be nice to consider large SCC as a single node, aggregating all incoming and outcoming peripheral edges
of original SCC.
On the preprocessing stage of the algorithm we reduce every SCC to a single node. The algorithm is not new and known as a graph condensation.

More formally:\par
\begin{definition}
TODO: Graph condensation definition
\end{definition}

In this article we use the following algorithm for finding graph condensation.
It was independently proposed by Kosaraju and Sharir back in 1979. \FIXME{Ссылку на эту статью} \par

First, we find topological sort of the initial graph. It takes O(E + V).
\begin{definition}
TODO: Topological sort
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}
Closure of node v is a set of all nodes reachable from v, including v.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}
TODO: Reachable
\end{definition}

When we finally have an array, containing graph nodes in the topologically sorted order, we do the following:

Define global array of used nodes. Initially, all nodes are unused.
Then for every node from bottom to top:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Acquire closure of unused nodes reachable from current node; 
    \item Mark every node in the closure as used;
    \item All the acquired nodes belong to the same SCC.
\end{enumerate}

The fact given in the last step can be shortly explained in the following way:
topological sort guarantees that any node has index larger than indeces of her children.
That is why, given that we process nodes from bottom to top, by the moment we process the node, all it's children are already marked used and no longer available for search.
As all the ways down are prohibited and there's no way up, we will acquire an SCC.

As a result of the algorithm, described above, we have each node associated with certain SCC.
SCCs itself form a graph with number of nodes less than or equal to one of the initial graph.

Finally, we need to remove edges duplicates and the graph condesation is built.

\subsection{Blackholes Search}
When the graph is prepared, we can move on to searching blackholes. The problem is combinatorial in its nature, therefore, we aim to
decrease the number of potential blackholes.
To understand the issue, we first describe a brute-force approach.

%TODO: осознать
In the BruteForce algorithm we iterate over all possible unordered sets of nodes. 
Then for every node we acquire its closure. Union of all such closures is a potential blackhole.
If the candidate blackhole is a weakly connected subgraph, then it is a blackhole.

With the BruteForce algorithm it is possible to find the same blackhole several times.
We aim to avoid at least some of the duplicates and introduce heuristic for it.

According to the definitions above if some node is not a root of a blackhole, it can be omitted, as set of roots uniquely identify a blackhole.
Every non-root node in a blackhole is reachable from one of the roots. Therefore, if we know reachability matrix for a given graph, we can skip bloated non-basis combinations of nodes.
Of course, we could straightforward build the reachability matrix. But it takes $O(V^3)$ time. \FIXME{определить $G=(V, E)$} Even though we decreased graph size in preprocessing step, it still can result in lots of computation. That is why we will only try to partially skip duplicates and the rest will be filtered later.

Let's consider a closure of a single blackhole root. Let this closure to be acquired by depth-first search, which basically means, that
we can iterate over these nodes in topologically sorted order. Also, while traversing this graph, we can calculate size of closure for each node
in the given roots closure. Finally, if some node is in the $i$-th position of the topological sort and its closure size is $i$, then we can 
conclude, that every node with index less than $i$ in the topological sort will be reachable from $v[i]$. \FIXME{определить v[i]}

\section{Experimental Results}
To demonstrate efficiency of our approach, we conducted a series of experiments. We ran the both algorithms (New Jersey and TopSort) on a 
set of graphs. 

For these experiments we chose Uniform Random (UR) \cite{random-uniform}, RMAT \cite{chakrabarti2004r},  and SSCA2 \cite{bader2005design} graph types. Those were generated for scales from 4 to 22
with step 2. Size $i$ means that graph has $2^i$ nodes and $32*V$ edges. Actual count of edges to process can differ from these ideal values, as duplicate edges and self-loops are omitted when reading graph from file. Configuration of the considered graphs is presented in Table \ref{tabular:graphs}.

We have been conducting our experiments on a Linux machine with the following specifications:
\begin{itemize}
    \item CPU: Intel Core i7-8550U CPU @ 4GHz
    \item RAM: 15802 MiB
    \item OS: Ubuntu 16.04 xenial
    \item Kernel: x86\_64 Linux 4.15.0-46-generic
    \item Shell: bash 4.3.48
\end{itemize}

All runs were performed in a single-thread mode. We allowed up to 20 minutes of working time for every run. In order to save time,
algorithms did not print out found blackholes, but printed counter on every found and not filtered (by any reason) blackhole.
